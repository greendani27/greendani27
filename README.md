<h1 align="center"> About me </h1>
Hi my name is Daniel and I'm a software developer.
At this moment, I'm learning Kotlin on my own, focusing on Android development.
In my short career as a software developer, I have been training in various technologies such as JAVA, Spring Boot, Docker, HTML, CSS3, React, etc.
